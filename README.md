# AR+Tensorflow!

Greetings! This is my github repo for handling AR/Computer Vision with Tensorflow. My intention is to use this to document my progress with learning tensorflow on Github so I can get more dark green squares, since all my other work involves things with API keys that I don't want to get out, and I feel it's a shame that I spent 3 years learning my favorite skill WebXR and have no green squares to show for it. I'm excited to show green squares for my progress learning tensorflow and machine learning in general, and maybe having a public repo will help me get better at doing open source git work as well. If you ever find yourself stumbling across and reading this, follow me on twitter @mathyouf and let me know why.

# Installation

**For Windows 10 with NVIDIA GPU**

## 1. Install ANACONDA

When using Tensorflow locally you'll need to have Python 3 installed. The current version of Python 3 that works with Tensorflow on Windows in 3.5, but that will likely change throughout this project.

When running tensorflow, you want to have control of the python and package version numbers, and so I recommend downloading [Install Anaconda for Windows 64bit](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). You must have a 64bit version of Python to run Tensorflow from what i've researched, and of course to install a 64bit version of Python you need to have a 64 bit version of windows. [How to check if you have 64 bit Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/am-i-running-a-32-bit-or-64-bit-version-of-windows-2624475).

Now that you have Anaconda installed, you can confirm this by typing

> conda --version
> And you should see the version.

## 2. Create Tensorflow Environment

You want to create an Anaconda virtual environment on which to run Tensorflow.

`conda create -n tensorflow-gpu python=3.5.2`

You can confirm that you've created it with

`conda env list

# conda environments:

#

base \* C:\Users\Admin\Anaconda3
tensorflow-gpu C:\Users\Admin\Anaconda3\envs\tensorflow-gpu
`
